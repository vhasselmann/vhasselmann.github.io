The world of Rock ‘n’ Roll has been silenced, so it’s time to get loud! Take up guitars and basses, and blow up the Silence Beasts with a BAAANG! Ride on rails all over the city, shredding riffs solo or jamming with your friends, and reclaim our city back in the name of Rock! Rock & Rails is a VR rail shooter with multiplayer in mind. Rock & Rails is a [GearVR action game](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1239388509475291/).
