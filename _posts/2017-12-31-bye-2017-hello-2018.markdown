So, 2017 has come to an end and with cool accomplishments. This year I have:

- Got married
- Released 3 games while working at [Black River Studios](https://twitter.com/blackrvrstudios)
- Wrote a technical [article](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/VictorHasselmann/20171030/308463/How_we_manage_scenes_and_takes_on_Angest_for_GearVR.php) about one of the system built for the [project](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1199148026798440/) that I was leading the engineering team.
- Moved to Europe;
- Started out with shader programming
- Bought a Hurdy Gurdy and started out playing it

It was one of the most interesting years so far and I expect that 2018 will be a better one. I would like to thanks everyone that helped make this a great year.
