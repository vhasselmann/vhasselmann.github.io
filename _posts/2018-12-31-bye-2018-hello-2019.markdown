So, 2018 has come to an end and with cool accomplishments. This year I have:

- Got my Italian citizenship & started my Italian classes
- Got my cats from Brazil to Dublin =^_^=
- Started Yoga classes
- Enrolled and finished an Interior Design Course at [DID](http://www.dublindesign.ie/){:target="_blank"} and met very nice people (Still waiting for my results, hopefully with merit or more <3)
- Released [Disney Coloring World](https://storytoys.com/apps/disney-coloring-world/){:target="_blank"} and [Hungry Caterpillar Play School](https://storytoys.com/apps/hungry-caterpillar-play-school/){:target="_blank"} app while working at [Story Toys](https://storytoys.com/){:target="_blank"}
- Learned great stuff about programming

I've had my **ups and downs** this year, it was crazy as f**, but I'm back in track with my spiritual believes and I set exciting goals for 2019 which also includes muss less procrastination, eating healthier and exercise more. Also, I expect to blog much more tech content here. :)
