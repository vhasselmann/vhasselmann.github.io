# Summary

My name is Victor, but people usually call me Vic. I have been developing games since 2012 and this is what I’m proud of doing. I have a large experience in game development. I'm passionate about development in special about software design and architecture and good practices.

I graduated myself in Tech. B. Of Game Development and System Analysis. Since then, I have successfully designed, developed and supported games. I strive for continued excellence and provide exceptional contributions to my colleagues and working team.

As I am very communicative, my goal is to make everyone in the project feel that somehow, we all are part of the project, that is something which keeps me going on and on.
